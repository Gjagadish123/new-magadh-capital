                companies stocks with healthy growth ahead of them – that is currently not
                fully recognized by the market - is crucial for wealth creation. At the same time
                entry price too plays an important role in stock returns. We work with the belief
                that stocks move as per their future potential – not on their past developments,
                and that having a long-term horizon is a must to reduce the element of luck in
                investments.</p>

                                          <p><strong>Keen for contrarian opportunities if convinced</strong>– We work with the premise that the strongest returns are made when a stock purchase is made amid extreme general pessimism.

                <p>Look for simple businesses – In portfolio construction we stick to the well-known saying “ If we do not understand a business, we don't buy it “. We avoid investments in stocks of companies having complicated business models with too many drivers and reliance on exotic modes of business growth.   </p>    -->
                                          <p>Timely identification of and corrective action on mistakes– Another aphorism that we take seriously is “If facts change we change our views”. While deep and wide fundamental research provides Magadh Capital an edge in its stock picks, there are still possibilities of some mistakes and in some instances, rapid erosion in business prospects. In such eventuality the portfolio strives to act quickly and to realign the portfolio to mitigate the impact of any mistake, or to reflect the change in business environment.</p>

                                          <p><strong>Bottom up is the way, though top-down guidance can be helpful too</strong>– We often begin investigating a stock on the basis of our screens, or sell side recommendations or media reports. Industry themes too can serve as good starting points even though final investment decision are largely driven by bottom-up/top down stock analysis.</p>

                            <p>Big companies have small moves, small companies have big moves (but remember to balance the risks) - The fund has some bias for smaller stocks though with a heavy emphasis on quality checks especially on corporate governance. However, we do understand that occasionally smaller stocks can be more volatile and hence the fund strives to keep some top quality large names too in the portfolio. Typical stock ideas on Magadh’s radar will have return potential of at least 200% and low downside risk over 4-5 years.</p>
                            
                            <p>Avoid hot stocks in hot industries – The fund does not intend to attempt to make gains in the short term since it works with the belief that there is no free lunch in the world of investments. Accordingly, seasonal flavours or themes in vogue are avoided by the fund. Application of sophisticated hedging instruments too does not gel with Magadh’s philosophy and hence the fund will not participate in any way in futures, options or other derivatives. Similarly, momentum strategy does not play much role in our stock selection process.</p> -->

                                          <p>Magadh Capital takes corporate governance standards as an extremely important
                            yardstick in its process. This is the first elimination parameter in its investment
                            process. Magadh Capital assesses the track record and the company’s perception
                            amongst its various stakeholders. Similarly, management vision and execution
                            capabilities are crucial criteria. Special focus is attached to management’s track
                            record on capital allocation and focus on shareholders’ return. </p>
                                          <p>Every stock that we invest in has some common traits - robust corporate
                            governance, good management, and existing or potential competitive
                            advantages. Apart from this the portfolio consists of a wide mix - some portion
                            of our portfolio is allocated to stocks that are out of favour in the markets for
                            some reason, while some portion is deployed in stocks that are set to deliver
                            solid earnings growth and return ratios. </p>

Here attempt is made to analyze last 10-15 years’ earnings, competition, entry barriers, suppliers, products, customers, capital allocation, and project execution in the context of industry. Companies’ annual reports, result presentations, interview with the company, and sell side analyst reports are some of the key source of information for this exercise. Conversation with senior managers as well as mid and low-level employees in the company is an integral part of this process. Equally important is the fact that the Investment Managers  talks to people (like customers, suppliers, competitors etc) in the company’s business ecosystem to get new and more perspectives.</p>
