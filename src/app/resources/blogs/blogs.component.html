                                            <p>Blaise Pascal, the famous French
                                                physicist of the 17th century,
                                                had once said “All of humanity’s
                                                problems stem from man’s
                                                inability to sit quietly in a
                                                room alone.”
                                                <br /> Understandably it is not
                                                easy to extol the virtues of
                                                laziness, or even of selective
                                                inaction. However, if laziness
                                                is resorted to consciously, with

                                                happiness. It can be of immense

                                                asked for his favorite equation.
                                                Napolean Bonaparte had once
                                                quipped “I’d rather have a lucky

                                                is one such phenomenon which in
                                                a sense is manifestation of
