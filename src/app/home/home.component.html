							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-align:justify">The first pan-Indian empire at its peak - sometime in the second century BC - Magadh was a cradle for knowledge in ancient India. It remained the centre of culture and learning in India for almost thousand years starting about 5th century BC. During this period there was rapid progress in politics, economics, literature, religion, and philosophy. While eminent centres of learning like Nalanda and Vikramshila universities flourished in Magadh, two great religions - Buddhism and Jainism, too were founded there.</p>

							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-align:justify">Magadh also saw some
								brilliant developments in the fields of mathematics, astrology,
								astronomy, warfare and medicine. Large parts of this era were marked by
								relative peace which was facilitated by the farsightedness of the
								leaders of the empire who focused on efficient mitigation of external
								and internal threats.</p>

							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-align:justify">This approach to life - of
								deep thinking, seeking wisdom, solid execution, and risk management -
								inspires us in every aspect of our philosophy and process at Magadh
								Capital. In our pursuit for excellence in fund management, this approach
								also helps us in our attempt to develop a mindset which seeks to
								identify facts, and their relationships.</p>

					<h2>INVESTMENT <span style="text-transform:uppercase;" class="text-primary">Framework</span></h2>
					<p style="text-align:justify">Magadh Capital’s portfolio construction is based on its proprietary FACTS boxes validation process which optimizes the risk-reward profile of the portfolio. The stock selection process is an intensive one based on a combination of qualitative as well as quantitative measures.</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify">We follow a conventional, disciplined approach backed by fundamental bottom-up/top-down research to identify good stocks with moderate risks at fair price. We are keen for contrarian opportunities if we see strength in a company that is being missed by the market for some reversible reasons.<br> Ours is a blend of growth and value styles. We look to figure out a stock’s fair value in a range backed by our fundamental equity research process and thus attempt to identify instances of market mispricing. DCF (Discounted cash flow) method forms the core of our valuation exercise though we do apply other methods too.</p>

					<h2>RISK <span style="text-transform:uppercase;" class="text-primary">MANAGEMENT</span></h2>
					<p style="text-align:justify;">We work with the understanding that markets are inherently risky. We see possibility of permanent capital erosion or of poor returns in the long run as the central risk factor and strive to minimize this risk - as our first goal. Magadh Capital does not see stock price dip due to short term volatility as a measure or indicator of risk.
						<br>
						Our investment philosophy and style have been influenced heavily by our focus on alleviation of risks in our pursuit for wealth creation for our investors. Our investment process is designed to assist us in identifying key risk factors, in trying to estimate the range of probabilities for various risk factors, and in thinking of impact of those risk factors. At the same time, while we score well on the scale of risk aversion, we are not loss averse over near term especially if we are convinced regarding long term opportunities.
