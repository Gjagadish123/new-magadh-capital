							<h3>The Magadh Connection</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-align:justify">The first pan-Indian empire at its peak - sometime in the second century BC - Magadh was a cradle for knowledge in ancient India. It remained the centre of culture and learning in India for almost thousand years starting about 5th century BC. During this period there was rapid progress in politics, economics, literature, religion, and philosophy. While eminent centres of learning like Nalanda and Vikramshila universities flourished in Magadh, two great religions - Buddhism and Jainism, too were founded there.</p>

							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-align:justify">Magadh also saw some brilliant developments in the fields of mathematics, astrology, astronomy, warfare and medicine. Large parts of this era were marked by relative peace which was facilitated by the farsightedness of the leaders of the empire who focused on efficient mitigation of external and internal threats.</p>

							<p style="font-size: 17px; text-align:justify">This approach to life - of deep thinking, seeking wisdom, solid execution, and risk management - inspires us in every aspect of our philosophy and process at Magadh Capital. In our pursuit for excellence in fund management, this approach also helps us in our attempt to develop a mindset which seeks to identify facts, and their relationships.</p>
