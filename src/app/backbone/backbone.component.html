							<p>Magadh Capital functions on the three broad pillars of –<br><br>
								<b>a) Integrity and transparency–</b> in the entire gamut of the portfolio management practices as well as in operations, and in the way it deals with all its stakeholders. Magadh Capital places a lot of emphasis on keeping the sponsors’/investment managers’ interests aligned with those of its investors. Indeed, corporate governance acts as the first and foremost filter in our investment process.

							</blockquote>

							<p>
								<b>b) Research and knowledge–</b> are the basic guiding principles at Magadh Capital for identifying stock ideas, portfolio construction and risk management. Learning is a continuous, ongoing process for us. We look at knowledge with a multi-disciplinary approach. Intensive reading, meeting people, deep thinking, having a curious mind, and attention to detail are some of the habits/practices/traits that we value in this regard.

								<p>If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes. – Albert Einstein</p>
							</blockquote>

							<p><b>c) Simplicity–</b> is what Magadh Capital practices, and adheres to during stock selection, and portfolio management – or for that matter, in everything that it does. For example, if a company’s business model is too complicated and vague then it may not be considered for inclusion in Magadh Capital’s portfolio.</p>
